# Introduction
The scope of this project is the creation of a GUI widget engine in pure C allegro that can be scripted in LUA.
This is the accumulation of several smaller projects and is planned to be the starting point for later projects.

The core of this engine is a stack of widgets and the custom callback for updating them.

This will be my first public project in a long time and will also serve as a my reeducation in git, licencing, and making regular commits.
So please be pacience with the mess and any "works on my machine" responces.
